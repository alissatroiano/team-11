## UX/UI SECTION  
### Project Goals and Desgin choices:
- The goal of this project is to create a fun star wars themed escape room game. 
- There will be a star Wars scrolling style intro text which explains the story of what has happened so far and what you must do.
- A space themed background which relates to star wars as it's set in space with different planets and galaxies. 
- White text in navigation with a transparent background so the the text is easy to read over the space background image.
- As all good websites have, each page will have a navigation menu at the top of the page. This will contain the headings play, how to play, and meet the team. This repetition is said to make user experiences better as users like it when a website has a common theme/layout, so that it then becomes quick and easy to learn and navigate through.
- The first page is naturally the home page. This will have the title of the game along with a play button
- The last page will be meeting the team. As this is the least important section of the website, it makes sense for it to be the last page.
- All games and designs will be animated and remain consistent throughout. 

### User Stories:

- As a user into star wars:
    - I want to feel as though I am playing a star wars themed escape room and not just a generic escape room
